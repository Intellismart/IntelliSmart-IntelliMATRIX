# Project Documentation Index

This folder contains the as-built documentation for IntelliSMART AI Factory. It reflects the current implementation in this repository and is intended for onboarding, audits, and handover.

Contents:
- as-built.md — End-to-end as-built overview of the system.
- sitemap.md — Human-readable site map of all routes and APIs.
- site-design.md — UX/UI design, components, and frontend architecture.
- security-design.md — Security posture, auth, tenancy, and controls.

How to use:
- Start with as-built.md for a complete picture.
- Use sitemap.md to verify expected pages and endpoints.
- Refer to site-design.md for frontend patterns and consistency.
- Review security-design.md before exposing the demo publicly.

Scope note: This is a production demo. Some behaviors are simplified by design for user testing (see limitations and backlog in each document).
